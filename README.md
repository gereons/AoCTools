# AoCTools

Various utility classes/structs for common tasks in [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) puzzles.

This includes support for 2D and 3D points, [hexagonal grids](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/), some `Array` and `Set` convenience methods, an [A\* pathfinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) and more.
